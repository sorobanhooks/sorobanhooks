**Sorobanhooks** is a real-time webhook-driven platform for developers to automate contract deployment, event monitoring, and cross-chain transactions on the Stellar and Soroban blockchains.

5. **Monitor Events**: Track real-time events related to Soroban contracts, including confirmations, failures, and status changes.
6. **Set Balance Alerts**: Set alerts for wallet balances when they cross predefined thresholds.
7. **Cross-Chain Transaction Monitoring**: Monitor cross-chain operations between Stellar and other blockchains.
